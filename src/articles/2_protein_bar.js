    The U.S. Dietary Guidlines state that an "<a
    href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthy-eating/do-you-eat-enough-protein" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adult man should take
    a minimum of 10% of his daily calories from protien"</a>, and if you're someone like me who needs a quick way to get
    some protein into your diet, then I'd highly recommend Clif Builder's Protein bars.

    I've tried a number of protein bars: <a href="http://amzn.to/2ietXfx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probars</a>, <a
    href="http://amzn.to/2yCkoNS">thinkThin</a>, to <a href="http://amzn.to/2yCQs4k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oh Yeah!</a>, and
    I've settled on Clif Builder's Protein bars based on taste, more organic/natural ingredients, and price.

    Unlike a lot of protein bars, Clif Builder's Protein bars do not use artificial sweeteners in their product.
    Obviously, this will increase the calories (almost all of their bars are 270-280 calories/bar) and carbohydrates. But
    when you eat their bar, it doesn't taste like you are eating a <em>protein</em> bar. There's no protein aftertaste; it
    literally tastes like your eating a candy bar with 20g of soy based protein.

    I really like the <a href="http://amzn.to/2hyrNKO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chocolate</a> flavor, but I tend to eat the
    chocolate mint and chocolate peanut butter most often cause <a
    href="https://www.samsclub.com/sams/clif-builder-s-variety/196623.ip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam's Club</a> carries those two
    flavors in bulk (~$20/box of 18). As of writing this article, they sell five flavors (chocolate mint, chocolate peanut
    butter, cookies n' cream, crunchy peanut butter, and vanilla almond) of this protein bar and they just released a <a

    Speaking of protein, Clif uses soy protein isolate which is a godsend since my stomach and whey don't really get along
    (probably due to my <a

    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chinese heritage</a>). They have a decent number of organic ingredients and it packs a number of
    vitamins & minerals (You can find more info on Clif's website <a
    href="http://www.clifbar.com/products/clif/builder-s/builders-chocolate-peanut-butter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>). I
    know tha GMO foods are <a

    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">generally safe for you</a>, but I personally like eating things where I can understand the ingredient
    list rather than looking up every other word. And just like how whey protein can wreak havoc on my gastrointenstinal
    tract, some artificial sweeteners have a similar affect on me; so these bars are a win-win for me.

    I am definitely a price sensitive consumer with very little brand loyalty (bite me), so I was thrilled to find out
    that I could purchase Clif Builder's Bars from my local <a
    href="https://www.samsclub.com/sams/clif-builder-s-variety/196623.ip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam's Club store</a> at around
    $1.11 per bar, even Amazon at one point were selling these bars at $13.58 per box of 12 this past year.

    I love these bars and I eat these <em>everyday</em>, it's probably fair to say that I'm 10% Clif Builder Protein Bar
    since you are what you eat :). If you get a chance, I'd recommend you try them. It's like eating a candy bar with 20g
    protein. Bliss.
