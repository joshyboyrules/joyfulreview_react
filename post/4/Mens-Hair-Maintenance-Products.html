width="100%"></div></div><p>In this article I'm going to breakdown for you all the products I use to cut the hairs on my body. I didn't realize it until I took inventory but I use four tools on the regular to keep all those hairs in place.</p><span class="post-section-header">Electric Shaver</span><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><img src="https://joyfulreview.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_0466.jpg" alt="Clif bar 1" class="rounded post-picture" width="100%"></div></div><p>This is probably the most common tool that I use on a everyday (or every other depending how lazy I am, plus I'm chinese, there's no such thing as a five o'clock shadow, maybe a five day shadow, I digress). Ever since I was a kid, I started using a Norelco shaver, and I have stuck with them because they do the job well and they don't break down; I've had mine <em>since 2014</em> and it's still going strong). I travel a couple times a year, and from my experience some shavers just break down after being tossed around; my Philips Norelco Electric obviously did not, it still keeps a week long battery charge, it shaves all my little asian hairs, and I've never had to buy replacement parts for it!</p><p>Obviously you could buy the <a href="http://amzn.to/2irncHA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">older version</a> that I have, or purchase the <a href="http://amzn.to/2irhyVG " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newer version</a>, I don't think you can go wrong with either one. I would even recommend <a href="http://amzn.to/2hBkTRu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon's choice</a> which is also a Philips Norelco.</p><span class="post-section-header">Nose Hair Trimmer</span><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><img src="https://joyfulreview.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_0471.jpg" alt="Clif bar 1" class="rounded post-picture" width="100%"></div></div><p>Right around my early twenties, I began noticing hairs starting to stick out of my nostril. At first I didn't really mind, but then the longer I stared at them, the more it bothered me and I decided it needed to be rectified. Unfortunately, I started out with a twisting nose hair blade that would somtimes catch onto my nostril hairs; so rather than cutting my nose hairs it would sometimes pull them out (super painful and unpleasent).</p><p>I "lost" that torture tool (I probably threw it away), and I discovered the<a href="http://amzn.to/2hAOM4i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KEDSUM Professional Portable Manual Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer</a>(yea, they probably need a new name), and it has been nothing short of bliss to use. Never again do I have to close my eyes and hope to God that my hairs don't get pulled out. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and it will last a long time (it's made out of stainless steel). Do yourself a favor and everybody else a favor by getting rid of those hairs that nobody wants to see :).</p><span class="post-section-header">Unibrow Tweezer</span><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><img src="https://joyfulreview.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_0475.jpg" alt="Clif bar 1" class="rounded post-picture" width="100%"></div></div><p>This can be a sensitive subject for some; it definitely is for me. I will probably never admit that I have a unibrow, I would probably still argue that I don't. I just have some hair growing on my face that happen to be between my two eyebrows. Whatever the case may be, I think there's always room for improvement; and I researched how to effectively and conveniently remove those hairs.</p><p>I settled on tweezers and I did some 'research' on Amazon and found that <a href="http://amzn.to/2hBnD1e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slant Tweezers by TweezerGuru</a> were the ones to go with. At the time of publishing this, they have over 7000 reviews with an average rating of 4.6 and they are #1 Best Seller. I personally use them probably once every couple days just to make sure those hairs in between my eyebrows never evolve into a unibrow :).</p><span class="post-section-header">Body Hair Shaver aka shaver for down below</span><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><img src="https://joyfulreview.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/img_0469.jpg" alt="Clif bar 1" class="rounded post-picture" width="100%"></div></div><p>I wish someone had told me when I was a kid that hair would grow on certain parts of my body during puberty. As I got older I was never really educated on how to handle body hair, especially hair around the groin area so I more or less ignored it and pretended like it wasn't there. Well you do that for long enough and there comes a point where there is <em>too much</em> hair below and something needs to get done. This is where the <a href="http://amzn.to/2isCNH0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philips Norelco Bodygroom Series 7100</a> comes into play.</p><p>I'm going to talk about stuff thinking that people can infer what I'm talking about. I've used this to trim my 'body' hair and it has <em>never</em> accidentally 'caught' and there were no serious injuries. I did have some minor scratches because I was feeling courageous and wanted to get cut it super short, so I took off the guard completely; yea, I wouldn't recommned, keep the guard on.</p><p><strong>Tip #1 - shave in the shower </strong><br>The Philips Norelco Bodygroom shaver is water-resistant so you can use it in the shower which is great. It saves you from adding too much to your daily routine, plus all the cut hairs can just drain down the water tube.</p><p><strong>Tip #2 - how to research on this topic</strong><br>If you ever want to do research on this topic, the keywords to search for are 'body shaver for men'. I've just saved you from accidentally viewing things that can never be erased from your memory. You're welcome.</p><span class="post-section-header">Hair Stylist</span><div>I can't cut my own hair, well technically I've never tried but I some things in life aren't worth trying. If you are someone who likes routine and likes consistency, I would personally recommend finding a hair stylist that you like and that you can build a long-term relationship with. I've been getting my haircut by the same person for the past ten years. She knows my likes and dislikes, she cuts my hair the way that I like it cut, and she's a great person as well. It's just a relief knowing that every five weeks I can go to the same person to get my haircut the way that I want it to be cut. One less thing to worry about.</div><p><small>If you're ever in Ann Arbor area and looking for a haircut, go to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DepotTownHairStation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hair Station</a> and ask for Courtney (she's the owner)</small></p></div><br><br><br></div></div><div class="col-md-3"><div><hr><small>Author</small><div class="row align-items-center no-gutters"><div class="col-3"><img src="https://joyfulreview.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/joshyu_author1.jpg" class="rounded" width="100%" alt="Joshua Yu"></div><div class="col-9" style="padding-left:10px"><small class="bold">Joshua Yu</small><br><small>Creator of Joyful Review</small><br><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="hover-click twitter-click"><path d="M23 3a10.9 10.9 0 0 1-3.14 1.53 4.48 4.48 0 0 0-7.86 3v1A10.66 10.66 0 0 1 3 4s-4 9 5 13a11.64 11.64 0 0 1-7 2c9 5 20 0 20-11.5a4.5 4.5 0 0 0-.08-.83A7.72 7.72 0 0 0 23 3z" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2"></path></svg>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="hover-click instagram-click"><rect x="2" y="2" width="20" height="20" rx="5" ry="5"></rect><path d="M16 11.37A4 4 0 1 1 12.63 8 4 4 0 0 1 16 11.37z"></path><line x1="17.5" y1="6.5" x2="17.5" y2="6.5"></line></svg></div></div></div><div><hr><small>Places to Buy</small><br><div style="padding-top:12px"><button class="btn btn-joy hover-click">Amazon</button></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/main.46b5bb71.js"></script></body></html>
