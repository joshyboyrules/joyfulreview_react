    In this article I'm going to breakdown for you all the products I use to cut the hairs on my body. I didn't realize
    it until I took inventory but I use four tools on the regular to keep all those hairs in place.

    This is probably the most common tool that I use on a everyday (or every other depending how lazy I am, plus I'm
    chinese, there's no such thing as a five o'clock shadow, maybe a five day shadow, I digress). Ever since I was a
    kid, I started using a Norelco shaver, and I have stuck with them because they do the job well and they don't
    break down; I've had mine <em>since 2014</em> and it's still going strong). I travel a couple times a year, and
    from my experience some shavers just break down after being tossed around; my Philips Norelco Electric obviously
    did not, it still keeps a week long battery charge, it shaves all my little asian hairs, and I've never had to buy
    replacement parts for it!
  </p>
  <p>
    Obviously you could buy the <a href="http://amzn.to/2irncHA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">older version</a> that I have, or
    purchase the <a href="http://amzn.to/2irhyVG " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newer version</a>, I don't think you can go wrong
    with either one. I would even recommend <a href="http://amzn.to/2hBkTRu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon's choice</a> which
    is also a Philips Norelco.

  <p>Right around my early twenties, I began noticing hairs starting to stick out of my nostril. At first I didn't
    really mind, but then the longer I stared at them, the more it bothered me and I decided it needed to be
    rectified. Unfortunately, I started out with a twisting nose hair blade that would somtimes catch onto my nostril
    hairs; so rather than cutting my nose hairs it would sometimes pull them out (super painful and unpleasent).
  </p>

  <p>I "lost" that torture tool (I probably threw it away), and I discovered the
    <a href="http://amzn.to/2hAOM4i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KEDSUM Professional Portable Manual Nose & Ear Hair Trimmer</a>
    (yea, they probably need a new name), and it has been
    nothing short of bliss to use. Never again do I have to close my eyes and hope to God that my hairs don't get
    pulled out. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and it will last a long time (it's made out of stainless steel). Do
    yourself a favor and everybody else a favor by getting rid of those hairs that nobody wants to see :).</p>

    This can be a sensitive subject for some; it definitely is for me. I will probably never admit that I have a
    unibrow, I would probably still argue that I don't. I just have some hair growing on my face that happen to be
    between my two eyebrows. Whatever the case may be, I think there's always room for improvement; and I researched
    how to effectively and conveniently remove those hairs.
  </p>
  <p>
    I settled on tweezers and I did some 'research' on Amazon and found that <a href="http://amzn.to/2hBnD1e"
                                                                                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slant Tweezers by
    TweezerGuru</a> were the ones to go with. At the time of publishing this, they have over 7000 reviews with an
    average rating of 4.6 and they are #1 Best Seller. I personally use them probably once every couple days just to
    make sure those hairs in between my eyebrows never evolve into a unibrow :).

  <span className="post-section-header">Body Hair Shaver aka shaver for down below</span>

    I wish someone had told me when I was a kid that hair would grow on certain parts of my body during puberty. As I
    got older I was never really educated on how to handle body hair, especially hair around the groin area so I more
    or less ignored it and pretended like it wasn't there. Well you do that for long enough and there comes a point
    where there is <em>too much</em> hair below and something needs to get done. This is where the <a
    href="http://amzn.to/2isCNH0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philips Norelco Bodygroom Series 7100</a> comes into play.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm going to talk about stuff thinking that people can infer what I'm talking about. I've used this to trim my
    'body' hair and it has <em>never</em> accidentally 'caught' and there were no serious injuries. I did have some
    minor scratches because I was feeling courageous and wanted to get cut it super short, so I took off the guard
    completely; yea, I wouldn't recommned, keep the guard on.
  </p>

    <strong>Tip #1 - shave in the shower </strong><br/>
    The Philips Norelco Bodygroom shaver is water-resistant so you can use it in the shower which is great. It saves
    you from adding too much to your daily routine, plus all the cut hairs can just drain down the water tube.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tip #2 - how to research on this topic</strong><br/>
    If you ever want to do research on this topic, the keywords to search for are 'body shaver for men'. I've just
    saved you from accidentally viewing things that can never be erased from your memory. You're welcome.

  <span className="post-section-header">Hair Stylist</span>
  <div>
    I can't cut my own hair, well technically I've never tried but I some things in life aren't worth trying. If you
    are someone who likes routine and likes consistency, I would personally recommend finding a hair stylist that you
    like and that you can build a long-term relationship with. I've been getting my haircut by the same person for the
    past ten years. She knows my likes and dislikes, she cuts my hair the way that I like it cut, and she's a great
    person as well. It's just a relief knowing that every five weeks I can go to the same person to get my haircut the
    way that I want it to be cut. One less thing to worry about.
