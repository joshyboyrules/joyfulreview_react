So I started my Android journey with the Nexus 6P, then the first Pixel XL and now I’m using the Pixel 2 XL as my daily driver (thanks<a href="https://swappa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swappa</a>for helping me sell/buy my phones).</p><h5>Controversy regarding the screen</h5><p>Yes, there is a blue hue when you shift your phone and it is noticeable when you view the phone from non-direct viewing angles. Yes, the colors are muted; I could immediately tell that the colors were less saturated when I switched from my Pixel XL. No, I haven’t had experience with the screen burn in. (to address these concerns and give consumers a peace of mind, Google has given<a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/phone-by-google/FRyoLZZjXvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all Pixel 2 users a 2 year warranty</a>)</p><p>Despite all of that drama and controversy I would still recommend the phone. Here are the following reasons why:</p><h5>True Android experience</h5><p>I love the fact that whatever is on my Pixel 2 XL is what Google intended to be on that phone. I don’t have to deal with third-party applications, a bastardized version of the OS, or worry when I would get the latest Android updates.</p><p>Even like the little things like unlimited photo backups into your Google Photos is such a huge convenience. With all Pixel phones, Google gives you unlimited drive space on Google Photos to upload all your photos at original resolutions; and with the base models being at 64gb, you shouldn’t ever have a problem with storage capacity.</p><p>The Pixel 2 XL has a number of preinstalled Google applications, but they give you the option to uninstall those applications if you don’t have any use for them (e.g. Daydream, Allo, etc.). It’s little things like this that make the experience using the phone a bliss.</p><h5>Camera</h5><p>The camera is simply put amazing. It’s the best phone camera that I have ever used (albeit I haven’t tried out the iPhone cameras). The lense is faster, sharper, and has better technology supporting compared to its predecessor. Here are some original photos (no color correction/filter) that I took with HDR+ enabled.</p><div class="row" style="padding-bottom:30px"><div class="col-md-6"><img src="https://joyfulreview.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/ww3024wwhh4032hhwedding1_11082017.jpg?w=840" alt="portrait mode" class="rounded" width="100%"><br><small>portrait mode</small></div><div class="col-md-6"><img src="https://joyfulreview.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/ww3024wwhh4032hhwedding2_11082017.jpg?w=840" alt="IMG_20171103_213352.jpg" class="rounded" width="100%"><br><small>colors are on point</small></div><div class="col-md-12" style="padding-top:30px"><img src="https://joyfulreview.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/ww4032wwhh3024hhfire1_11082017.jpg?w=840" alt="IMG_20171104_220135.jpg" class="rounded" width="100%"><br><small>low light shot</small></div></div><p>The portrait mode is a nice addition which enables the bokeh (blurry background) in the photo’s background. It’s worth noting that every time you take a picture in Portrait mode, it saves the original photo and the processed bokeh photo, and both versions of the photo are also uploaded to Google Photos.</p><h5>Google Assistant Squeeze</h5><p>I was never a fan of allowing my phone to be unlocked via ‘Ok, Google’ command since it isn’t very secure (I’ve seen my phone unlocked by other people imitating my voice). So I found myself using the voice command less to initiate the Google Assistant. With the Pixel 2, you can now start up Google Assistant via squeezing the sides of your phone (it only works on the bottom half of the phone, below the volume buttons). And I am finding myself using the Assistant more and more on a daily basis; whether it’s for driving directions, calling or texting a contact, scheduling events, finding out when a store opens / closes, and even using<a href="http://ifttt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IFTTT</a>to expand its capabilities.</p><hr><p>Of course if I’m going to talk about the good, I also have to talk about the no as good. Here are a couple annoyances that I have found.</p><hr><h5>Issues with Bluetooth</h5><p>I drive a 2011 Acura TSX and with my prior Pixel XL, I could skip tracks through Spotify/Google Music using the car media controls however this no longer works 😦 and when I switch bluetooth media devices (e.g. phone and car), my previous Pixel would remember the volume settings, and that no longer works either. Hopefully this is just a software issue and can be fixed with a software update.</p><h5>$$$</h5><p>The Pixel 2 XL base cost is $850, and with tax it comes to be around $900, and when you buy<a href="http://amzn.to/2zoGXZz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a case to protect your investment</a>it comes up to be wopping $950. This is by no means a cheap phone, and when buying a new phone always remember that you will need to pay tax on the base price (unless you buy through a third party vendor), and expect to spend at least $30-50 on a case to protect that baby of yours.</p><p>All in all, it’s a joy to use the Pixel 2 XL as my daily driver.</p><div style="display:none"><p id="author">{<br>“image”: “joyfulreview.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/joshyu_author.jpg”,<br>“name”: “Joshua Yu”,<br>“position”: “Creator of Joyful Review”<br>}</p><p id="buy">{<br>“image”: “joyfulreview.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/ww3024wwhh4032hhwedding1_11082017.jpg”,<br>“link”: “amzn.to/2zoGXZz”,<br>“title”: “Pixel 2 XL”<br>}</p></div><p> </p></div></div><div class="col-md-3"><div><hr><small>Author</small><div class="row align-items-center no-gutters"><div class="col-3"><img src="http://joyfulreview.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/joshyu_author.jpg" class="rounded" width="100%" alt="Joshua Yu"></div><div class="col-9" style="padding-left:10px"><small><strong>Joshua Yu</strong></small><br><small>Creator of Joyful Review</small></div></div></div><div><hr><small>Places to Buy</small><br><a href="http://amzn.to/2zoGXZz" target="_blank">Link</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/main.07fb2979.js"></script></body></html>
