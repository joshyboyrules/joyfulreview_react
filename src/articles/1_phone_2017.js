    A little background: I was a previous iPhone user for many years, starting with the iPhone 3GS, then working my way
    up with to the elongated iPhone 5, and that’s when I found myself in a pickle and figured to give Android a shot
    since I wanted to buy phones @ no-contract price and most of the apps I used on the iPhone had an Android equivalent
    (sorry <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Things</a>, I still love
    you.) So I
    started my Android journey with the Nexus 6P, then the first Pixel XL and now I’m using the Pixel 2 XL as my daily
    driver (thanks <a href="https://swappa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swappa</a> for helping me
    sell/buy my
    phones).
  </p>

  <span className="post-section-header">Controversy regarding the screen</span>
  <div>
    Yes, there is a blue hue when you shift your phone and it is noticeable when you view the phone from non-direct
    viewing angles. Yes, the colors are muted; I could immediately tell that the colors were less saturated when I
    switched from my Pixel XL. No, I haven’t had experience with the screen burn in. (to address these concerns and give
    consumers a peace of mind, Google has given <a
    href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/phone-by-google/FRyoLZZjXvo" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">all
    Pixel 2 users a 2 year warranty</a>)
  </div>

  <p>Despite all of that drama and controversy I would still recommend the phone. Here are the following reasons
    why:</p>

  <span className="post-section-header">True Android experience</span>
  <div>
    I love the fact that whatever is on my Pixel 2 XL is what Google intended to be on that phone. I don’t have to deal
    with third-party applications, a bastardized version of the OS, or worry when I would get the latest Android
    updates.
  </div>
  <p>
    Even like the little things like unlimited photo backups into your Google Photos is such a huge convenience. With
    all Pixel phones, Google gives you unlimited drive space on Google Photos to upload all your photos at original
    resolutions; and with the base models being at 64gb, you shouldn’t ever have a problem with storage capacity.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Pixel 2 XL has a number of preinstalled Google applications, but they give you the option to uninstall those
    applications if you don’t have any use for them (e.g. Daydream, Allo, etc.). It’s little things like this that make
    the experience using the phone a bliss.
  </p>

  <p>
    People from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16486108/google-pixel-2-xl-review-android-phone-camera"
                   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Verge</a> would agree with me, saying it is the "Best
    Android experience" with
    "Great Speakers" (yay for dual front-facing speakers on the Pixel 2 XL) and the "Incredible Camera".
  </p>
  <span className="post-section-header">Camera</span>
  <div>

    The camera is simply put amazing. It’s the best phone camera that I have ever used (albeit I haven’t tried out the
    iPhone cameras). The lense is faster, sharper, and has better technology supporting compared to its predecessor.
    Here are some original photos (no color correction/filter) that I took with HDR+ enabled.

    The portrait mode is a nice addition which enables the bokeh (blurry background) in the photo’s background. It’s
    worth
    noting that every time you take a picture in Portrait mode, it saves the original photo and the processed bokeh
    photo,
    and both versions of the photo are also uploaded to Google Photos.
  </p>

  <span className="post-section-header">Google Assistant Squeeze</span>
  <div>
    I was never a fan of allowing my phone to be unlocked via ‘Ok, Google’ command since it isn’t very secure (I’ve seen
    my phone unlocked by other people imitating my voice). So I found myself using the voice command less to initiate
    the
    Google Assistant. With the Pixel 2, you can now start up Google Assistant via squeezing the sides of your phone (it
    only works on the bottom half of the phone, below the volume buttons). And I am finding myself using the Assistant
    more and more on a daily basis; whether it’s for driving directions, calling or texting a contact, scheduling
    events,
    finding out when a store opens / closes, and even using <a href="http://ifttt.com/" target="_blank"
                                                               rel="noopener noreferrer">IFTTT</a> to expand its
    capabilities.
  </div>

  <p>
    Of course if I’m going to talk about the good, I also have to talk about the no as good. Here are a couple
    annoyances
    that I have found.
  </p>
  <hr/>

  <span className="post-section-header">Issues with Bluetooth</span>
  <div>
    I drive a 2011 Acura TSX and with my prior Pixel XL, I could skip tracks through Spotify/Google Music using the car
    media controls however this no longer works :( and when I switch bluetooth media devices (e.g. phone and car), my
    previous Pixel would remember the volume settings, and that no longer works either. Hopefully this is just a
    software
    issue and can be fixed with a software update.
  </div>

  <span className="post-section-header">$$$</span>
  <div>
    The Pixel 2 XL base cost is $850, and with tax it comes to be around $900, and when you buy <a
    href="http://amzn.to/2zoGXZz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a case to protect your investment</a> it
    comes up to be
    wopping $950. This is by no means a cheap phone, and when buying a new phone always remember that you will need to
    pay
    tax on the base price (unless you buy through a third party vendor), and expect to spend at least $30-50 on a case
    to
    protect that baby of yours. If you pre-ordered the Pixel 2 XL it comes with a 'free' Google Home (I got the
    exclusive
    coral) so that kind of offsets the cost... kind of not really. I also opted into Google's Trade-In program to sell
    my
    previous Pixel XL, the estimated trade-in value was $400, I'll letyou know
  </div>

  <span className="post-section-header">Other pleasentries</span>
  <div>
    You will be pleasently surprised by the little things, such as the always-on OLED for notifications (nice to not
    have
    to tap your phone to see if you have notifcations), the kind of gimmicky Google Lens (AI detecting what's in your
    photos, I haven't found real use for it yet), and the VR stuff if you're into that. If you are interested in more of
    that kind of stuff, go check out the 'Other Reviews' section to see how other people rated the Google Pixel 2 XL and
    how their opinion more or less agrees with mine :) (how it's a great phone).
  </div>

  <span className="post-section-header">Geeking Out</span>
  <div>
    If you're into benchmarks, and like to talk about how fast your phone (or not so fast your friend's phone is) then

  <p>
    All in all, it’s a joy to use the Pixel 2 XL as my daily driver for the rest of 2017 and will be going into 2018.
    Thanks for reading!
